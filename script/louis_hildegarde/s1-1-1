Louis: "Excuse me, mother, I'll have to borrow Hilda for a minute."1
Hilda: "What's the matter, now?"1
Mother: "Why, but you haven't even touched your cookies yet."1
Charles: "I'll eat them if he won't."1
Catherine: "I say we follow them so he won't do anything weird."1
Louis: "Er, no, that won't be necessary... we'll be back shortly."1
Hilda: "Well, what is it with you?"1
Louis: "That's something I should say. Whatever gave you the idea\that you could just waltz into my house and make yourself\at home like this?"1
Hilda: "Nom, nom, nom... well... nom, I..."1
Louis: "Put that cookie down!"1
Hilda: "Hey! That's not nice. Your family likes me, why don't you?"1
Louis: "They don't like you, they're just... nosy. Besides, you're\making me look like a fool."1
Hilda: "You were already a fool before. If you weren't, you'd appreciate\having a cultured lady at your house to liven up the mood."1
Louis: "You're neither cultured nor a lady!"1
Hilda: "You know what?"1
Louis: "What?"1
Hilda: "You kind of look like a girl when you're upset."1
Louis: "That does it! Get out of here, and never ask anything of me\ever again. And take this stupid cookie with you!"1
Hilda: "Why... does that mean you're kicking me out?"1
Louis: "So I am. Now leave before I'm forced to carry the expression\to its literal consummation."1
Hilda: "Fine. I'll go."1
Louis: "......"1
Louis: "......"1
Mother: "Why, Louis, you're back, but... where's Hilda?"1
Louis: "She left just now. Charles can eat my cookies."1
William: "He already has."1
Mother: "Where are you going, dear? Did something happen?"1
Catherine: "Lovers' quarrels, probably. It'll pass. I know all about it."1
Charles: "No, you don't."1
