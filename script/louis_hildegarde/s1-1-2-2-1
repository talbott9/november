Louis: "...... How was it?"1
Hilda: "Nice enough."1
William: "That wasn't bad, I guess."1
Catherine: "Stop it, big brother, you're making me feel embarrassed!"1
Louis: "Why?"1
Charles: "I guess you weren't completely inept after all."1
Catherine: "Yeah, there's at least one thing you can do well,\big brother. Be glad."1
Catherine: "There's at least one thing in this whole wide world\that you're not completely useless at! Think about it."1
Louis: "I don't feel the least bit encouraged..."1\............1\Clang! Clang! Clang!1
Louis: "(The bells? Already this late?)"1
Mother: "Why, this late already! With such great company, I could\hardly feel the time go by."1
Hilda: "I think I should go, now. My parents don't like me staying\out too late."1
Mother: "You're welcome any time, dear. Again, it's a shame\Margaret wasn't here today..."1
Louis: "I'll see to it that she gets home safely."1
Louis: "........."1
Hilda: "........."1
Catherine: "........."1
Louis: "Why are you following me?"1
Catherine: "To see to it that she gets home safely."1
Louis: "Well, now, do I have to lay down to you the hierarchy of this\family once again?"1
Catherine: "Sure, whatever."1
Louis: "This family is a monarchy. Father's the King, Mother's\the Queen, I'm the herald and you're the maidservant."1
Catherine: "Uh, huh..."1
Louis: "Now you must be thinking: isn't it unfair that my big brother\gets a higher rank than me simply because he was born earlier,\while I have to be a lowly servant?"1
Louis: "But that's just how the world works! It's how it's always\worked. You just have to deal with it."1
Louis: "Imagine if we were suddenly to get together and elect you\to replace Mother as the Queen of the family.\That would be ridiculous, wouldn't it?"1
Catherine: "I guess..."1
Louis: "So, in deference to this hierarchy, will you respect your\older brother when he tells you to leave him alone?"1
Catherine: "........."1
Catherine: "Huh. That neighbor already has his Christmas decorations\up, even though it's only November."1
Louis: "......"1
Hilda: "Chuckle!"1\..................1
Catherine: "Well, we're here."1
Louis: "Can't you stay quiet? I'm trying to pretend you're not here."1
Hilda: "You have a very interesting family, don't you, Louis?\Can I come again some time?"1
Catherine: "Sure!"1
Hilda: "Thank you."1
Catherine: "You're welcome!"1
Louis: "I feel like I'm talking through an interpreter..."1
Hilda: "Well, goodbye, Louis."1
Louis: "See you later, Hildegarde."1
Catherine: "Wait! Aren't you forgetting something?"1
Louis: "I guess I haven't bought my mouse yet..."1
Catherine: "What are you even talking about? What I mean is, aren't you\forgetting, you know, a certain thing common to this kind of occasion?"1
Catherine: "You know, I mean, a... k-k-k-k-k-k... gasp!"1
Louis: "(Is this stupid girl really...? I should just end this before\Hildegardecatches on... huh?)"1
Louis: "(No, I can't believe it... Even Hildegarde! Is there nothing this\world can't corrupt?!)"1
Louis: "(Well, now that I think about it, I guess it's quite natural... But I\just didn't think... well...)"1\Do it\\Don't1
