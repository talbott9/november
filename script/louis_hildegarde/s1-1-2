Catherine: "Don't even dream of marrying my big brother, if you can't\    get at least this good."1
Mother: "Why, you silly girl, who said anything about marriage? I hope\that doesn't vex you, Hilda."1
Hilda: "Nom, nom... noph aph all..."1
Louis: "I wonder how she talks like that...?"1
Mother: "Incidentally, what do you think of my little boy? You know\he's never had a girl here. I was worried he might\turn into an old bachelor like his uncle."1
Louis: "That wouldn't be that bad..."1
Hilda: "Oh, nom, nom, he's nice enough all right... I think he inherited\some of your looks, in a way..."1
Louis: "What does that mean?"1
Hilda: "He's helped me with my computer sometimes, so I thought'd\I'd repay the debt... In fact, he didn't even invite me in\the house. The door was open so I just kind of walked in!"1
Catherine: "I knew it! This was all too unprecedented to be true!\    I was right again!"1
William: "I also kind of figured but I didn't want to say anything."1
Charles: "Shame on you, big brother, letting a girl pull you by the\nose."1
Louis: "W-what?"1
Mother: "I guess it's not rare nowadays for girls to take the initiative.\I wonder how Louis feels about our Hilda?"1\She's ugly\\She's fine, I guess1
