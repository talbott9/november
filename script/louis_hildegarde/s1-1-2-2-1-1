Louis: "(Hold on, is this even right? We've never been this kind of... well...)"1
Louis: "(But then again, what am I going to say? "No thanks, I have other\interests?" Isn't that rather more of an insult?)"1
Louis: "(Shouldn't at least we shake hands before we do this, or something?\Are we even friends yet? Don't we have to be friends first?)"1
Louis: "(How do I keep getting into these situations? Why me? What did I ever do?)"1
Catherine: "Big brother, she already left. It's getting dark. Let's go home."1
Louis: "(Do other people even exist? Is reality an illusion, a fabrication\of the senses?)"1
Catherine: "Are you all right? Big brother...? Louis...?"1\Catherine went home that day and informed her brothers of the seemingly catatonic\state she had left her brother in.1
       Worried, they hurried back to Hildegarde's house. However, their\brother had left no trace of his former presence.1
       He had left for a world-wide journey to find himself and the truths of\this world, never to return.1
       Rumours say he has been spotted recently somewhere in Switzerland carrying\a lit lantern, with which he claims to be in quest of a man.1
