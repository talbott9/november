Louis: "(I wonder how I should say this?)"1
Hilda: "Nom, nom, nom..."1
Louis: "I think there's been a mistake. I have never said I felt anything\about Hildegarde. I have only feelings of benevolence towards\her human nature! But if the truth were to be known..."1
Hilda: "Nom, nom, nom..."1
Louis: "I mean, what I mean to say is..."1
Hilda: "Nom, nom..."1
Catherine: "Well, big brother?"1
Louis: "(This is bad... the words won't come out! My heart races!\Why am I struggling so much?)"1
Louis: "(Why, just think about it... this is just like entering a cold\shower. Delaying only makes it harder to get in.)"1
Louis: "(Or maybe it's like going to school? You can cut class, but\it'll only force you to study harder later on.)"1
Louis: "(Wait, that's not right... What if you do better studying\on your own? Should you be forced to attend class\nevertheless?)"1
Louis: "(Should you just see school as preliminary training on good\societal conduct? Doesn't that lower it to the level of a\correctional facility?)"1
Louis: "(No, wait... but what if...)"1
Hilda: "Thanks for the cookies. I think I'll go home now."1
Mother: "So early, Hilda? You know you could stay for as long as you\want and we wouldn't mind."1
Catherine: "Yeah, Louis could even lend you his room overnight.\    He can sleep on the floor or something."1
Hilda: "That's very nice of you to suggest, but I just remembered\I had some homework to do."1
Mother: "Why doesn't Louis go with you? He'll help you with your\homework. He's very smart, you know."1
Hilda: "Maybe some other time. It was very nice to see you,\Mrs. Langton."1
Mother: "Come back at any time, dear."1
Louis: "......"1
Louis: "Sigh..."1
