Hilda: "Let's go to "The Store"."1
Louis: "Huh? Which store?"1
Hilda: "The Store... don't you know it? It has everything."1
Louis: "That's silly... there's no store in this neighborhood named\"The Store"."1
Hilda: "Oh, yes, there is. Come with me and you'll see."1
Louis: "This is ridiculous..."1
Hilda: "See? The Store."1
Louis: "I don't remember this being here."1
Hilda: "It was only built a couple of months ago... maybe you didn't notice."1
Louis: "This doesn't look like it has everything."1
Hilda: "It's bigger on the inside than it looks."1
Clerk: "Welcome to The Store! How can I help you?"1
Louis: "Er... do you sell computer mouses?"1
Clerk: "We sell anything!"1
Louis: "Do you sell happiness?"1
Clerk: "No."1
Louis: "......"1
Clerk: "......"1
Clerk: "Here is your mouse, sir."1
Louis: "That's not a mouse... that's a piece of tofu with a cord attached\to it."1
Hilda: "Does it work, at least?"1
Clerk: "You can test it on this computer."1
Louis: "That's not a computer... that's a giant piece of tofu."1
Clerk: "Yes, and?"1
Louis: "......"1
Clerk: "......"1
Hilda: "......"1
Louis: "I'll take one."1
Clerk: "That'll be five dollars, sir."1
