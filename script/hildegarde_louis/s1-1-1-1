Hilda: "Say, I think I'll go with you. You need my moral support...\at this rate you'll just drop out in the first semester."1
Louis: "How so? As soon as you get there they'll find out\you're stu... that you cheated and send you back."1
Hilda: "I'll figure out something."1\The next day...1
Louis: "What's that?"1
Hilda: "Can't you tell?"1
Louis: "No, I meant "what's that that's wrong with your head that\makes you think I'll wear this?""1
Hilda: "It was the best I could think of."1
Louis: "Sigh... Do you really think they won't tell it's me?"1
Hilda: "I've checked the time tables. There's nothing preventing this\plan from succeeding."1
Louis: "That's not what I mean."1
Hilda: "Oh, I also got two pairs of glasses. Plain lenses, of course...\It'll make us harder to tell apart."1
Louis: "I know I'll regret this..."1
Hilda: "I'd like to do a kind of test drive first, of course...\you know... make sure the disguise doesn't fail at the worst moment."1
Hilda: "Here, put it on."1\............1
Hilda: "Wow, it works better than I thought. It's like we're twins."1
Louis: "Respectfully disagree."1
Hilda: "Okay, just walk to school like this, and if nobody tells\you're not me, we'll call it a success."1
Hilda: "Why, that's just perfect... Here comes Margaret, try to act like me.\I'll be watching from there."1
Louis: "W-wait..."1
Marg.: "Hilda? What are you doing standing there?"1
Louis: "H-hi, Margaret."1
Marg.: "Your voice sounds awful... have you got a cold?"1
Louis: "Ah, yeah, sure... They say dumb people don't get colds, but I\guess that was just a saying!"1
Marg.: "...are you going to school now? I thought your house was down\the street."1
Louis: "I just felt like coming over here... go on without me..."1
Marg.: "Er, okay... get well soon."1
Louis: "Sigh..."1
Hilda: "Hmm... I guess that was good enough. But I never noticed how\deep your voice was... That's definitely going to need work."1
Louis: "Can I take this off now?"1
Hilda: "Wait... there's Blanche. A good opportunity to get\some further practice."1
Louis: "Good grief..."1
Blan.: "Hi, Hilda! Wow, you look great today! New high heels?"1
Blan.: "Right, you don't wear high heels... how'd you get so tall?\You must've added five or six centimetres since I last saw you."1
Louis: "Well... maybe you just didn't notice until now."1
Blan.: "But we checked your height just last week, when we were going\shopping for clothes. Don't you remember?"1
Louis: "Er... now that I think about it."1
Blan.: "Haha, I was kidding... That didn't happen..."1
Louis: "........."1
Blan.: "........."1
Louis: "........."1
Blan.: "Um... I think I'll go now. Bye!"1
Louis: "That's tough..."1
Hilda: "Okay, I only have one quick correction point..."1
Louis: "No, that's enough! Let's leave before someone else comes by\and I end up embarrassing myself."1
Hilda: "I don't think there's enough time..."1
Louis: "What?"1
Hilda: "I'll be supporting you from a distance..."1
Louis: "Wait..."1
Long.: "......"1
Louis: "......"1
Long.: "Hildegarde?"1
Louis: "Yeah?"1
Long.: "You look weird today."1
Louis: "I get that often..."1
Long.: "Have you been lifting weights? Your shoulders look quite broad."1
Louis: "Nothing wrong with that..."1
Long.: "Quite a pleasant face as usual, though."1
Louis: "......"1
Long.: "Well, I'm going now. See you."1
Louis: "Whatever."1
Louis: "......"1
Hilda: "You weren't even trying this time, were you? And yet he didn't\notice anyway. I think we're set."1 
Louis: "I think he noticed..."1 
Hilda: "If he did, he would have said so, wouldn't he?"1
Louis: "I'm going home."1
Hilda: "But there's still school after this. Aren't you going to school?"1
Louis: "Not today..."1
Hilda: "Okay... see you tomorrow."1
Hilda: "You know, there's something I've been wondering for a while...\How come they can't tell my version of the test was copied over?"1
Louis: "I wrote it in a different hand."1
Hilda: "No, I mean, wouldn't they tell it's not my usual handwriting?"1
Louis: "So...? They don't seem to have suspected anything so far.\If it comes down to it, just tell them you wrote it with\your left hand or something."1
Hilda: "But I'm not ambidextrous. Besides, that would be lying."1
Louis: "What? And is sending me to pretend I'm you in class not lying?"1
Hilda: "No, that's a mental reservation... it's very different."1
Teacher: "Louis Langton? Can you come with me for a second?"1
Louis: "Er, fine... Hold on, I'll be back."1
Louis: "Hmm..."1
Hilda: "Well? You've been silent this whole time... What was it?"1
Louis: "The program's been canceled. Someone set off an explosive\at the ---- headquarters."1
Hilda: "A bomb?"1
Louis: "No one was hurt, but the building was badly damaged...\They say it'll cost a good deal of money to repair it."1
Hilda: "Well... I guess you won't need that disguise anymore."1
Louis: "Yeah... here you go."1
Hilda: "No, keep it as a souvenir. Maybe you'll need it again someday."1
Louis: "I hope not..."1
Hilda: "Like, for example, there's this test next week..."1
Louis: "I think I'll just leave it here on the ground."1
