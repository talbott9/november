Hilda: "I've never see you anywhere at school."1
Louis: "So? We don't study in the same class."1
Hilda: "Yes, but I should have seen you somewhere at lunch break, at least."1
Louis: "I don't eat lunch..."1
Hilda: "Really? What do you do during lunch break then?"1
Louis: "Read detective novels."1
Hilda: "Wow, you must be really lonely..."1
Louis: "I'm not."1
Hilda: "How many countless days must you have spent burying your\sorrows in detective novels?"1
Louis: "None..."1
Hilda: "I'd say some kind of change is in order."1
Louis: "It's not."1
Hilda: "I'll show up tomorrow... I have an idea. Don't worry,\I won't charge for it, if you're wondering."1
Louis: "That's great because I wouldn't pay."1
Hilda: "I'll see you tomorrow at school."1
Louis: "Er... okay."1
Louis: "Huh, so the girl with the eye patch, the street, the culprit,\and the first victim all had the same name? I believe it..."1
Louis: "........."1
Hilda: "........."1
Louis: "........."1
Louis: "What are you staring at me for? It's disconcerting."1
Hilda: "Aren't you going to play this game I made for you?"1
Louis: "What do you mean "made"? It's just a bunch of sticks."1
Hilda: "If you win, you get to keep them."1
Louis: "So? There's no shortage of sticks in this country."1
Hilda: "Well, what about this? I'll make it more interesting...\if you win, I'll do anything you want."1
Louis: "Really? What about robbing a bank?"1
Hilda: "No, then it'd be gambling. Of course, if I win, I also get\you to do what I want."1
Louis: "Whatever, let's get it over with."1
Hilda: "I'll explain the rules again: we alternately take two or five\sticks out of the cup; whoever gets the last stick of the\thirty loses."1
Hilda: "Ready? I'll go first!"1
           Take two\\Take five1
Louis: "Oh, ho."1
Louis: "Hmm..."1
