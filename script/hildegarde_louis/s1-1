Hilda: "I've never see you anywhere at school."1
Louis: "So? We don't study in the same class."1
Hilda: "Yes, but I should have seen you somewhere at lunch break, at least."1
Louis: "I don't eat lunch..."1
Hilda: "Really? What do you do during lunch break then?"1
Louis: "Read detective novels..."1
Hilda: "......"1
Louis: "......"1
Louis: "Why are you looking at me like I'm a pathetic creature?"1
Hilda: "Well, I suppose that's not the worst thing to do...\say, you're from --- class?"1
Louis: "That's right..."1
Hilda: "I'll give you a little helping hand... I'll help you spice up\your life a bit... Don't worry, I won't charge for it."1
Louis: "That's great, I wouldn't pay. (whatever it is)"1
Hilda: "I'll see you tomorrow at school."1
Louis: "Er... okay."1\The next day...1
Louis: "Huh... so the man with the cane, the street, and the victim\all had the same name? I believe it..."1
Louis: "........."1
Hilda: "........."1
Louis: "........."1
Louis: "What are you staring at me for? It's disconcerting."1
Hilda: "Aren't you going to play this game I made for you?"1
Louis: "What do you mean "made"? It's just a bunch of sticks."1
Hilda: "If you win, you get to keep them."1
Louis: "So? There's no shortage of sticks in this country."1
Hilda: "Well, what about this? I'll make it more interesting...\if you win, I'll do anything you want."1
Louis: "Really? What about robbing a bank?"1
Hilda: "No, then it'd be gambling... of course, if I win, I also get\you to do anything I want."1
Louis: "Whatever, let's get it over with..."1
Hilda: "I'll explain the rules again: we alternately take up to\three sticks out of the cup; whoever gets the last stick of the thirty loses."1
Hilda: "Ready? I'll go first!"1
