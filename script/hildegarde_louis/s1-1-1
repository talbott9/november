Hilda: "Wow, I won!"1
Louis: "Yeah, whatever..."1
Hilda: "Now you have to do what I say for a whole day!"1
Louis: "Wait, wait! Who said it was for a whole day?"1
Hilda: "Huh? Wasn't it for a day?"1
Louis: "No! Let's look at a recap, shall we?"1\.........1
Hilda: "Well, what about this? I'll make it more interesting...\if you win, I'll do anything you want. I'm stupid!"1\.........1
Hilda: "I didn't say "I'm stupid...""1
Louis: "See? No mention of a whole day."1
Hilda: "What if I command you to do anything I say for a whole day?"1
Louis: "I don't even have a whole day... I have to do homework."1
Hilda: "That's it! I'll have you do my homework."1
Louis: "That sounds immoral..."1
Hilda: "It's okay, I can justify myself in court."1
Louis: "Everyone says that..."1
Hilda: "Here, you can return it to me tomorrow right before the first period."1
Louis: "Sigh..."1\A day later...1
Teacher: "I am here to inform you all of the results of yesterday's test."1
Student 1: "But teacher... there was no test yesterday."1
Teacher: "For evaluation purposes, we were not able to disclose its\status as a test. Most of you are probably aware of the disproportial\difficulty of yesterday's homework compared its precedents."1
Teacher: "The truth is that it was really a NASA scouting test\disguised as a third-year middle-schooler's homework. Students who are able to get\a full score on it are eligible to a special NASA scholarship."1
Student 2: "What!? No wonder I wasn't able to solve a single question."1
Student 3: "I thought I'd gotten the wrong print..."1
Hilda: "(Huh, I guess that's kind of interesting... but from what\I've seen, there's not really anyone in my class that smart.)"1
Teacher: "This year there have been two in this school. One from\class ---, the other from this class."1
Student 2: "What!? I didn't know we had someone like that here."1
Student 3: "I wonder who the genius is."1
Teacher: "The student whose name is called please step up in\front of the class..."1
Teacher: "Hildegarde Joan Flandrin!"1
Hilda: "..............."1
Louis: "Well, what are you going to do?"1
Hilda: "At first I thought about just admitting it wasn't mine,\but then I thought I should ask you first..."1
Louis: "What? Why?"1
Hilda: "Couple of reasons... If they find out you did my homework,\that might lead to some problems..."1
Louis: "Is that so? I think they'd be pretty understanding once I\explained the circumstances. Besides, I don't even know if I want to go."1\I'll go with you\\You're right1
